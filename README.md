Developed a real-time sign language recognition system that translates hand gestures into readable text using computer vision and machine learning. The system captures live video feed, detects and tracks hand landmarks using MediaPipe, extracts key features, and classifies them using a trained deep learning model. The recognized signs are then dynamically converted into text and displayed on the interface.
